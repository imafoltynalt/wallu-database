If users need help they’ll need to reach out to @SupportMail (User ID: 1082707872565182614) for assistance.

Supportmail offers them 4 assistance categories: General Support, Verification (Stuck with verifying for example), Redeem Reward (Redeeming a reward like a giveaway) and Partnership (Partnering with SIlver Advertising server).

The Silver Advertising server uses a strike system. Server staff (Staff Team & HR Team) can give strike(s) based on the severity of what you did. When you reach 5 strikes, you will be kicked and at 7 strikes you’ll be banned. You can appeal a strike by DM’ing SupportMail and clicking on the “General Support” category. 

Upon joining the Silver Advertising server, you have to verify yourself via Double Counter. If you have trouble verifying (cannot verify/bot has you have an alt but you don’t), DM SupportMail and choose the “Verification” category.

If you win a giveaway or boost the server and want to claim your special perks, DM SupportMail and pick the category “Redeeming Reward”.

If you want to grow your server, partnering with Silver Advertising is a great idea. Firstly, make sure to read #📗︱how-to-partner. Make sure you do everything listed there for the best chance of partnering.

If your advertisement has broken the rules, Staff may delete your advertisement. You can see the reason in #🔺︱open-moderation.

Make sure to follow the channel’s specific category (eg Gaming, Community) for your ad to not be deleted!

At the “Timed Ads” category, there will be channels with a specific slowmode time. Make sure that your server doesn’t break any of Silver Advertising’s rules that can be found in #📖︱rules.

In the “Looking For” category, the same applies with the Timed Ads category. However, do make sure to read the #🔎︱lf-rules.
